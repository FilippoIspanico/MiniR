\title{Calculate Confidence Interval for Effect Difference}
\usage{
ci.diff.effect(effect1, effect2, alpha, k, g, n, mu, Spool, effect.names)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect1}{Integer. Index of the first effect.}

\item{effect2}{Integer. Index of the second effect.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (e.g. 0.05 for 95 percent confidence).}

\item{k}{Integer. Total number of intervals being calculated (for Bonferroni correction).}

\item{g}{Integer. Number of groups or treatments.}

\item{n}{Numeric vector. Sample sizes for each group.}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector. Means of each group.}

\item{Spool}{Numeric. Pooled variance estimate.}

\item{effect.names}{Character vector. Names of the effects or treatments.}
}
\value{
A matrix with one row, containing the lower (inf) and upper (sup) bounds of the confidence interval.
        The row is named as the difference between the two effects.
}
\description{
This function calculates the confidence interval for the difference between two effects
using the t-distribution and Bonferroni correction.

ci.diff.effect(1, 2, 0.05, 3, 3, c(10, 10, 10), c(5, 6, 7), 2, c("A", "B", "C"))
