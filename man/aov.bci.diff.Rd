\title{Calculate ANOVA Bonferroni Confidence Intervals for Differences}
\usage{
aov.bci.diff(fit.aov, effect.factor, mu, alpha, k = NULL, round.3 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit.aov}{An object of class 'aov', typically the result of a call to aov().}

\item{effect.factor}{Factor. The factor variable representing all treatments.}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector. Means of each treatment group.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level (e.g., 0.05 for 95% confidence).}

\item{k}{Integer, optional. Number of intervals to calculate. If NULL (default),
all pairwise differences are calculated.}

\item{round.3}{Logical. If TRUE (default), round the results to 3 decimal places.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each row represents a pairwise difference between treatments.
        The columns give the lower (inf) and upper (sup) bounds of each confidence interval.
}
\description{
This function calculates Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals for all pairwise
differences between treatment effects in an ANOVA model.
}
\note{
If k is manually set, it should only be done when the problem specifically
      asks to compute a subset of all differences. For all differences, leave k as NULL.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'my_aov' is an aov object and 'treatment' is your factor variable
aov.bci.diff(my_aov, treatment, c(10, 12, 15), 0.05)
