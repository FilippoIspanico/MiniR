\title{Multivariate Analysis of Variance Homogeneity and Normality Test}
\usage{
m.aov.hptest(data, effect1, effect2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or vector containing the response variable(s).}

\item{effect1}{A vector specifying the levels of the first factor.}

\item{effect2}{An optional vector specifying the levels of the second factor for two-way designs. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
The function returns different objects based on the input:
  \itemize{
    \item For univariate data with one factor: A matrix with Shapiro-Wilk test p-values and variances for each level of effect1.
    \item For multivariate data with one factor: A vector of Mardia's multivariate normality test p-values for each level of effect1.
    \item For univariate data with two factors: A matrix with Shapiro-Wilk test p-values and variances for each combination of effect1 and effect2.
    \item For multivariate data with two factors: A vector of Mardia's multivariate normality test p-values for each combination of effect1 and effect2.
  }
}
\description{
This function performs homogeneity and normality tests for multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) 
or univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) designs. It can handle one-way and two-way designs for 
both univariate and multivariate data.
}
\details{
The function uses Shapiro-Wilk test for univariate normality and Mardia's test (from the MVN package) 
for multivariate normality. It also calculates variances (for univariate data) or covariance matrices 
(for multivariate data) for each group.

For multivariate data, the function produces plots of the covariance matrices.
}
\note{
This function requires the 'MVN' package for multivariate normality tests. 
Make sure it's installed before using this function for multivariate data.

# One-way univariate example
data <- rnorm(100)
effect1 <- rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50)

# Two-way multivariate example
data <- data.frame(y1 = rnorm(120), y2 = rnorm(120))
effect1 <- rep(c("X", "Y", "Z"), each = 40)
effect2 <- rep(rep(c("Low", "High"), each = 20), 3)
result2 <- m.aov.hptest(data, effect1, effect2)
